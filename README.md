# no language can run everywhere at once
**NB:** Vaporware at the moment

`no` is a language written in itself and compilable to anything. The syntax is
hosted by Perl, which is the only language with enough linguistic flexibility
to provide mixed `quote` functionality (though it would be trivial to write a
custom parser/grammar for it to break that dependency).
